<h2>Sherri Wasserman constructs experiences at the intersections of physical, multimedia, and informational landscapes. She makes things for print, digital, and architectural/environmental spaces, creating content-rich exhibitions, installations, books, websites, and mobile apps for wide-ranging audiences. </h2> <h3>Her clients have included the National 9/11 Memorial Museum, the MIT Museum, the American Folk Art Museum, the Gapminder Foundation, Biosphere 2, Todo Mundo/David Byrne, NYU Abu Dhabi, and the Smithsonian. She was a member of the inaugural <a href ="http://situated.systems/"> Experimental Research Design Lab team </a> at Autodesk’s Pier 9, an artist-in-residence at the Prelinger Library, and a Santa Fe Art Institute resident artist; she maintains an ongoing affiliation with the metaLAB at Harvard University and is an <a href ="https://csi.asu.edu/imaginary-college/"> Imaginary College Fellow </a> with the Center for Science and Imagination at Arizona State University. Wasserman received a Bachelor of Arts in visual arts and history from Oberlin College and a master’s degree from the Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. She is currently pursuing a PhD within ASU’s Human and Social Dimensions of Science and Technology program in the School for the Future of Innovation in Society.</h3>

<h3>As a professional team member, she's designed <a href="https://www.thincdesign.com/project/infinite-variety"> novel ways of experiencing historic quilts</a> <span style="color: darkgray">(roles: concept designer, project director)</span>, <a href="https://www.thincdesign.com/project/rivers-of-ice"> a layered approach to communicate climate change</a> <span style="color: darkgray">(roles: lead designer, project director)</span>, <a href="https://www.f-in-d.com/">multimedia stories that extend both cultural knowledge and mid-career artists' and scholars' forms of work</a> <span style="color: darkgray">(roles: design director, creative producer, design collaborator for FIND fellowship projects)</span>, <a href="https://www.unifiedfield.com/work/neurosociety/"> platforms that enable discussion around values and perception</a> <span style="color: darkgray">(roles: director of experience design, project lead)</span>, and <a href="https://www.thincdesign.com/project/international-orangutan-center"> collaborative interfaces to be used between orangutans and visitors </a> <span style="color: darkgray">(roles: media prototyping lead, content developer)</span>, amongst many other projects. She has extensive experience in both digital and physical approaches, from concept design and master planning through production and fabrication.</h3>

<h3>Before joining the design industry full time, she worked as an archivist, fine art photographer, documentary researcher, and museum educator. Her ongoing personal projects include long-term documentary work on the institutionalization (and omission) of narratives about the US nuclear-industrial complex, zines*, and handmade books. She also occasionally writes for <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2019/08/15/convoy-your-enthusiasm-15/"> HiLoBrow</a>.</h3>

<h3>In 2021 Wasserman is a PhD candidate concentrating on developing new models of public imagination for how we survive better together. She continues to collaborate in the design industry on projects for major institutions and undertakes select additional projects such as design of branding/identity, graphics, websites, and print publications. While working on her dissertation research, she also serves as a research assistant on scholarship regarding how communities impacted by oil and gas pipelines engage with civic processes. Her dissertation, a Science and Technology Studies approach grounded in her studies of environmental justice, knowledge production systems, complex adaptive systems science, and futures methods, is titled CONSTRUCTING SURVIVAL: Collaborative Imaginations in the Face of Social-Ecological-Technical Uncertainty.</h3>
