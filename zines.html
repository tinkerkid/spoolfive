<h2>some zines</h2>

<h3>Most of these zines, with only one exception, were created in ways which allow for on-screen reading and/or DIY print and assemble. The Situated Knowledges zines were distributed as physical copies during the <a href="http://situated.systems/">Situated Systems</a> residency at Pier 9. For each of the other zines, I created a limited amount of printed, hand bound copies which I distributed as gifts.</h3></p>
